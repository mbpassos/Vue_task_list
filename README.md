## About the project - Specifications

Laravel + Vue + MySQL database + Botstrap  

The user must be able to:
- add tasks to the list
- remove tasks
- when the task is complete the user must be able to mark it as complete

The project used local database to allow the user to save, edit, and delete tasks. 

The project was mportant for me to practice Vue componets hierarchy, Vue router and connection between laravel and Vue componets.
